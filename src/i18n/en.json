    "paragraph4": "Bear in mind that each post's container <strong>image weight and meta-details</strong> values, coupled with the \"area\" and relative order of each post will be taken into account when choosing an appropriate internal layout for each post. So, for example, a very horizontal post with a low image weight and no meta-details, will use a markup and styling that will put a small image on the left, plus a title and small excerpt.",
    "paragraph5": "The interpretation of each post's attribute value is up to the site theme. The logic here doesn't prefer one visual style over another.",
